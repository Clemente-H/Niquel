## Recent Improvements

We've made significant progress on the frontend-backend integration:

1. **Complete Authentication Flow** ‚úÖ:
   - Implemented protected routes that correctly redirect to login page when not authenticated
   - Fixed the authentication context to properly verify tokens
   - Implemented proper logout functionality
   - Ensured auth state is maintained between page refreshes

2. **Project Management Integration** ‚úÖ:
   - Connected Dashboard, ProjectList, and ProjectDetail to load real data from the API
   - Implemented the ProjectForm for creating and editing projects with real API connections
   - Added proper error handling and loading states throughout the app
   - Created FileUploader component for file management

3. **Key User Experience Improvements** ‚úÖ:
   - Added role-based access controls throughout the interface
   - Implemented client-side filtering for projects
   - Created data transformation layers between backend and frontend formats
   - Added loading indicators and error messages for better user feedback

## Next Steps

Our immediate next step is to implement the UserManagement page with real API connections. This will allow administrators to create, edit, and manage users in the system.

After that, we'll work on the Period Management interface to create and edit periods for projects.

## Completed Work Summary

We have successfully implemented:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Login, register, and logout functionality
   - Protected routes with role-based access control
   - Token validation and secure storage

2. **Core Services Layer**:
   - API client with request/response interceptors
   - Domain-specific services for all entities
   - Data transformation between backend and frontend

3. **Project Management**:
   - Dashboard with real-time project data
   - Project listing with filtering and searching
   - Project details view with period selection
   - Project creation and editing form
   - File upload component for document management

## Setup and Running the Application

### Running the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
