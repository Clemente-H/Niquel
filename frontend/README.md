# Project Management System - Frontend

A TypeScript React frontend for a role-based access control project management system, focused on water resource management projects.

## Project Vision

This frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing water resource projects, including canals, rivers, and other hydrological systems. It offers tools for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing data across different time periods.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with role-based permissions
- **Project Dashboard**: Overview of all projects with filtering and search
- **Project Details**: Comprehensive view of project data, maps, and measurements
- **Period Management**: Track and compare data across different time periods
- **Data Visualization**: Display measurements, maps, and analysis results
- **User Management**: Admin controls for managing system users and permissions
- **File Management**: Upload, store, and organize project-related files

## Initial Plan vs Current Progress

### Initial Plan
- [x] Phase 0: Planning and architecture design
- [x] Phase 1: Project setup with TypeScript, React, and Vite
- [ ] Phase 2: Authentication system implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Dashboard and project listing
- [ ] Phase 4: Project details and period management
- [ ] Phase 5: Data visualization components
- [ ] Phase 6: User management interface
- [ ] Phase 7: File upload and management
- [ ] Phase 8: Integration with backend API
- [ ] Phase 9: Testing and optimization

### Current Progress
- [x] Project setup with TypeScript, React 18, and Vite
- [x] TailwindCSS configuration for styling
- [x] Type definitions for all entities (users, projects, periods)
- [x] Layout components (DashboardLayout, AuthLayout, Header, Sidebar, Footer)
- [x] Common UI components (Button, Card, StatusBadge)
- [x] Route configuration with React Router and lazy loading
- [x] Login page with form validation (using mocked data)
- [x] Dashboard page with project listing and filtering
- [x] Role-based route protection

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as bundler
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **React Router** for routing
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Axios** for API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Project Details Page**:
   - Implement project information display
   - Add period selection and visualization
   - Create map visualization component

2. **Implement Project Form**:
   - Create/edit project functionality
   - File upload components
   - User assignment interface

3. **User Management Interface**:
   - User listing with filtering
   - User creation and editing
   - Role management

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - API service implementation
   - Authentication with JWT
   - Real data fetching and state management

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd project-manager/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:5173

### Test Credentials
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: password

## Development Considerations

- The frontend currently uses mocked data; real API integration is pending
- All components are built with responsive design in mind
- Role-based access control is implemented throughout the UI
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled for better type safety
- Code follows consistent naming conventions and best practices
