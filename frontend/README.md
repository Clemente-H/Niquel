# Project Management System - Frontend

A TypeScript React frontend for a role-based access control project management system, focused on water resource management projects.

## Project Vision

This frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing water resource projects, including canals, rivers, and other hydrological systems. It offers tools for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing data across different time periods.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with role-based permissions
- **Project Dashboard**: Overview of all projects with filtering and search
- **Project Details**: Comprehensive view of project data, maps, and measurements
- **Period Management**: Track and compare data across different time periods
- **Data Visualization**: Display measurements, maps, and analysis results
- **User Management**: Admin controls for managing system users and permissions
- **File Management**: Upload, store, and organize project-related files

## Implemented Features vs. Initial Plan

### Initial Plan ✓ = Completed
- [x] Phase 0: Planning and architecture design
- [x] Phase 1: Project setup with TypeScript, React, and Vite
- [x] Phase 2: Authentication system implementation
- [x] Phase 3: Dashboard and project listing
- [x] Phase 4: Project details and basic period management
- [ ] Phase 5: Data visualization components (partially done)
- [x] Phase 6: User management interface
- [x] Phase 7: File upload interface (UI only, backend integration pending)
- [ ] Phase 8: Integration with backend API
- [ ] Phase 9: Testing and optimization

### Current Implementation Status
- [x] Complete UI component library (Button, Card, StatusBadge, etc.)
- [x] Authentication layouts and forms (Login, Register)
- [x] Project dashboard with filtering and search
- [x] Project details page with period selection
- [x] Project creation and editing forms
- [x] User management page with role-based filtering
- [x] File upload components (UI ready, backend integration pending)
- [x] Role-based access control with protected routes
- [x] Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Real data fetching from API (currently using mock data)

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as bundler
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **React Router** for routing
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Axios** for API calls (integration pending)

## Next Steps

1. **State Management and API Integration**:
   - Implement global state management for auth and app state
   - Create API service layer to replace mock data
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

2. **Complete Visualization Components**:
   - Implement data visualization for project periods
   - Add interactive map components
   - Create charts and graphs for analysis data

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement period creation and management
   - Add data export functionality
   - Implement user notifications

4. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Implement end-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization and code cleanup

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd project-manager/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:5173

## Development Notes

- The frontend currently uses mocked data; real API integration is pending
- All UI components and pages are ready for API integration
- The application follows a modular approach for easy maintenance
- Role-based access control is implemented throughout the UI
- Form validation is in place for all input forms
